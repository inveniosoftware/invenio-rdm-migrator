# Usage:
#   ./run-tests.sh [-K|--keep-services] [pytest options and args...]
#
# Note: the DB, SEARCH and MQ services to use are determined by corresponding environment
#       variables if they are set -- otherwise, the following defaults are used:
#       DB=postgresql, SEARCH=opensearch and MQ=redis
#
# Example for using mysql instead of postgresql:
#    DB=mysql ./run-tests.sh

# Quit on errors
set -o errexit

# Quit on unbound symbols
set -o nounset

# Check for arguments
